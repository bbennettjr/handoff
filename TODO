Things to do:
1. Fix flashing condition bug when list item is checked
3. Somehow indicate who you are when you are logged in.
4. Add doctor chat
2. Build mobile app
7. Either manually add users or do email verification somehow.
8. Make a user put in their medical number and create an account. Two step verification
9. Adding users and verification: Referal system each user gets 3-5 invites.  Promotes verified doctor invites and exclusivity
10. "Sort" with dropdown menu for sort options (status, location, diagnosis, etc)
11. create Handoff, LLC -> evaluate our own paperwork vs company creation service (sprite?)
12. Add medication mongo collection with search-like drop down to add meds to pt easily
13. Same as medications but for vitals -> create easier way to input vitals
14. Improve patient search UI to distinguish multiple similar patients 
15. Follow up with Dr. Karen Scoles (Chief Medical Information Officer) and Cheryl Ralph (IT Director) about details of local install, next steps for us and contract negotiation ($$$$$)
