Things to do:
1. Rewrite with Material-ui
2. Build mobile app
3. Look up HIPAA compliance AWS situation (try to setup)
4. Better "no-patient" view (description of app, "lift" to yourself)
5. Edit button on patient view (reuse 'new patient view')
6. Search feature for patient (another url search parameters)
7. Either manually add users or do email verification somehow.
8. Make a user put in their medical number and create an account. Two step verification
9. Adding users and verification: Referal system each user gets 3-5 invites.  Promotes verified doctor invites and exclusivity

(TOP BUTTONS - add all of these on select to the top navigation bar)
